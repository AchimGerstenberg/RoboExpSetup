This repository includes files and documents describing the experimental setup of an experiment conducted by Achim Gerstenberg at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in 2017/18.
The purpose of this GitHub repository is to provide researchers the necessary ressources to replicate the experimental setup or adapt it to their needs.
These resources are accompanied by an academic publication that was presented at the Nord Design Conference in Linkj√∏ping in August 2018. The publication is available on Researchgate under https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327118039_Open_ended_problems_-_A_robot_programming_experiment_to_compare_and_test_different_development_and_design_approaches
